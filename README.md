# Rock Paper Scissors Vs The Robots
In this game, you need to defeat the robots using the classic game [rock paper scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors). You can save the world by beating the Skynet or dooming the world by losing the battle against the robots. The human race destiny is in your hands, literally. But don't worry, you can always try again by sending an anti-terminator back!
